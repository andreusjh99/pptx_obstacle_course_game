# Powerpoint Obstacle_course_game
Something I did for fun

## General Info
An obstacle-course-like game created solely using Microsoft PowerPoint. To play the game, simply view the slideshow and there will be instructions and user interactions throughout. It is fairly straight-forward. To edit the game, simply edit it using the `.pptx` file.

## Files
* `game.ppsx`: The slide show for the game. Opening this should bring you straight into the game.
* `game.pptx`: The original `.pptx` file for the game. To edit the game use this file. After done editing, simply 'Save as...' a `.ppsx` file to replace the existing `.ppsx` file.
